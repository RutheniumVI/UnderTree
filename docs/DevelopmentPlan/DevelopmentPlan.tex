\section{Team Meeting Plan}

	The team will meet twice a week on Tuesday and Thursday evenings between 6:00 PM and 7:30 PM. The length of meeting time may be adjusted according to the demands of the upcoming deliverable, setbacks and points of discussion. The meetings will take place primarily in the engineering library meeting rooms. Members may join through Discord or Messenger call or chat, and some meetings may be held completely virtually when appropriate.

\subsection{Rules for Agenda}
The rules for the agenda for all team meetings are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  The members will alternate being the designated note-taker and chair for each meeting
    \item Meeting minutes will be taken accordingly 
    \item The meeting agenda will focus on planning for the next milestone, agreements for distribution of the work, discussion of any pain points or concerns from any members, and review of current progress as necessary
    \item All members are expected to attend meetings either in person or virtually
    \item Members should prepare for meetings by noting down their current progress, roadblocks and any concerns that have arisen prior to the meeting
    \item The meeting will primarily be lead by the chair of each meeting, however the remaining members are expected to contribute to discussions and provide insight
    \item Meetings should conclude with decisions being made regarding the topics discussed
\end{enumerate}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

	The team will primarily communicate in person as most meetings will occur in person. The secondary avenue of communication will be through Messenger text chat or Discord voice chat. These may be used to address critical issues as they occur outside of meeting times, or issues and concerns that may be resolved quickly and efficiently in a virtual manner. The codebase and documentation will be managed through GitHub. Code quality reviews and tasks will assigned and communicated through GitHub comments and tasks. Members are expected to make appropriate merge and pull requests when contributing to the repository.

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Technology}

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Libraries you will likely be using?
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}
