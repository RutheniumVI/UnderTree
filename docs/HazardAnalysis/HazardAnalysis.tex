	\section{Introduction}
	
	% \wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}
	This document outlines the hazard analysis for the Undertree Latex editing software. Undertree is a collaborative Latex editor that allows multiple users to edit a Latex document concurrently, and also provides version control capabilities. The software is complex and consists of multiple components that work together to provide the intended functionalities. As such, each component runs the risk of failure due to hazards that may affect the system's behaviour.\\
	
	\noindent For the purpose of this document a hazard is defined as a state of a system along with an action on the system that would lead to the system integrity being damaged or causing a complete failure.\\
	
	\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
	
	The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed analysis of the possible hazards to the system, their causes, and the intended preventative measures that will be taken against them.\\
	
	\noindent First, any critical assumptions will be stated. These are assumptions that will eliminate the need for preventing a hazard as it is assumed to never occur. This is followed by the failure mode and effect analysis which will present a detailed table documenting all components and their potential failures, causes of the failures, effects of the failure, and preventative measures. Then, the safety and security requirements will be derived from the FMEA table and outlined as NFRs. Finally, the document will present a roadmap for when these security requirements will be implemented.\\
	
	\noindent When considering the hazards for this project, the following hazards are out of scope as they are not directly part of the project:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Issues with the user's browser such as compatibility with out of date or legacy browsers such as Internet Explorer are not part of the scope of the project.
		\item Issues with the rented hosting hardware and it's uptime are not part of the scope of the project.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{System Boundaries and Components}
	The system consists of 4 distinct major features that also make up our system boundaries are:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Client - The client is the latex editor that will be accesses in a web browser, and it has the following components:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Editor
			\item Chat box
			\item Logging in into the application
		\end{itemize}
		\item Server - The server is what the client will be communicating with to acces the main functionality which are:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Accessing the database
			\item File Synchronization
			\item Latex Compilation
			\item Chat Synchronization
			\item Authentication
			\item GitHub Integration
			\item Latex Editor
		\end{itemize}
		\item Github - Our application will also be using GitHub API to carry out various git functionality
		\item Database - Our application will also be saving user specific data to the database
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\section{Critical Assumptions}
	
	We are making the following assumptions when considering our hazards:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The user will be using the most up to date version of a Chromium based browser, Firefox, or Safari to prevent any hazards with the front-end system.
		\item Users and admins will not have direct access to the database, all access to the database will be defined by strict queries executed from the back end
		\item We will not be considering any issues that may arise on strictly just the front-end from a user acting maliciously, as this will only effect the malicious user them self. For example, if a user tries to create a fake and invalid access token from their browser, this token would not work and cause errors for the user when trying to communicate with the back-end until this token is cleared and a valid token is accessed by logging in.
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{enumerate}[{NFR}1.]
		\setcounter{enumi}{23}
		\item The system’s code will only be view-able to the public through the Git repository
		\item The system restricts it's editing privileges for the code to only the maintainers\\
		{\color{red}Fit Criterion: Users will be able to view the source code on the \textbf{GitHub} repository page}
		\item Users can only access projects that they are authorized to do so
		\item The system will retrieve the minimum required data needed for the user
		\item The system will provide appropriate errors to communicate system issues to user
		\item The system will provide necessary confirmations to crucial changes
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Integrity Requirements}
	\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
		\item The system will not manipulate or modify any of the user’s data that is stored on it
		\item The system will protect itself from intentional abuse
		\item The system will back up the data in the database frequently
		\item The system will retain user's projects even after being deleted for a few days 
		\item The system will store the editor data locally on the client's device 
		\item The system will implement strict measures in the back end to prevent unintentional behaviour
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Privacy Requirements}
	\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
		\item The system will require the user to create an account
		\item The system will not use the user's personal information for anything than what is required and consented to by the user
		\item The system will store all user credentials securely
		\item Users can only access projects that they are authorized to do so
		\item The system will renew API keys regularly
		\item The system will re-authenticate the user when required
	\end{enumerate}

	\section{Roadmap}
	
	Some of the new requirements that were discovered as part of this Hazard Analysis will be phased in alongside our Requirements mentioned in \href{https://github.com/RutheniumVI/UnderTree/blob/main/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{\textcolor{blue}{SRS document}}. Due to project time constraints, some of the requirements will not be able to implemented within the final project deadline. However since most of the hazards are integral towards the functional requirements, we will be looking to implement solutions for all hazards aside from the database backup. 
	
	% The requirements related to the following components will be implemented by the final revision are presented in the table below\\
