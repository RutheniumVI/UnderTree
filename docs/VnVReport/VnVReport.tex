	\subsection{Usability}
	
	\subsection{Use task walk-through}
	
	To evaluate our application's usability, Usability test was done with 4 invested stakeholders using use tasks. The 8 use tasks that were used during the each individual test run were:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Creating a new project
		\item Importing an existing project
		\item Editing a document and committing it to GitHub
		\item Uploading a local file and committing it to GitHub
		\item Creating files inside folders
		\item Sending messages in the chat
		\item Editing a document and compiling it
		\item Adding new collaborators to the project
	\end{itemize}
	Observation techniques were then used to record main pain points that arose while achieving the use tasks which are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item When adding collaborators while creating project, its not very intuitive that clicking on the user id will remove them from the collaborator list
		\item When adding collaborators, an indication on whether their username or email is required should be there. It would be better if both options were available.
		\item The icons for buttons need alternate text and need to be more intuitive
		\item Some of the errors messages had grammar errors
		\item It is easy to forget to select the check boxes before pressing commit
		\item Confirmation and success messages should be available for when commit button is pressed
		\item When uploading a file, the file name should be auto-filled to file that was chosen
		\item An indicator while the file is loading will be helpful
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Changes Due to Testing}
	
	%\wss{This section should highlight how feedback from the users and from 
		% the supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular 
		% the feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users) 
		% should be highlighted.}
	
	Throughout the development of this project, testing played a big part helping clarify and modifying the functionalities and the completeness of the services. After testing and validation we were able to confirm that the following changes would be needed to finalize this project:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Add spell checking since this is a missing functionality\
		\item Delete, and modify functionalities are not fully complete since removing or renaming a file does not update the change for other users until they refresh
		\item Using user feedback we were able to tell that having to enter in a path name when creating or renaming a file increases the complexity of the user interface
		\item Having access to additional file types such as .bib files and potentially code files to be able to import code snippets into LaTeX may be helpful
		\item The functionality to commit files and add commit messages is not fully done since deleted files are not updated in the repository
		\item Accessing large TeX files from the editor is slow and negatively impacts the user experience which was reflected in our responsiveness survey. Thus, changes are currently being made to load documents when project loads, rather than when file is opened
		\item A big issue most users had during our usability testing was them forgetting to select the checkbox before pressing upload, thus that functionality has been tweaked such the commit button is visibly disabled until files are selected
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\section{Automated Testing}
	
	All unit tests that are described above are done using automated testing using the Jest testing framework. This is a extremely useful framework since it allows us to easily mock any of the more complex features such as the GitHub integration which is out of scope as it would require integration testing rather than unit testing to be fully tested. Having these unit tests run after making a new change helps us be confident that all features are still functioning as intended. Additionally adding the unit tests into our CI/CD pipeline helps us ensure that any new commits to the main branch do not break the functionality of the project.

	\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}
	
	The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
	graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question: \\
	
	% \begin{enumerate}
		% \item 
		In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
		from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
		differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
		these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
		projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
		predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
		evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
		teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
		% \end{enumerate}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Faiq: Our original VnV plan was relatively simple and we assumed we would be easily able to unit test the vast majority of our project relatively simply. However once we got to actually implementing the unit tests, we realized the complexity of specific functionalities such as testing the GitHub integration that were located throughout our various services. For example, for creating a project we would need collaborators that were added to the project from our system to also be added to GitHub, however to actually have them fully added on GitHub, the user would need to first accept the invitation sent to their email. Thus, there is no simple way to unit test this and it starts to delve into the scope of integration testing since we would need to add the functionality of accepting the invitation and then checking GitHub to see if the collaborator has finally been added. Though this is possible in theory, we did not originally plan for this when writing our VnV plan and as a result did not allocate enough time to be able to go so far out of scope for our testing. Additionally, our original VnV plan also had relatively weak testing for the user interface and general usability. As we developed the project further, these usability tests were modified to help us get better user feedback on how we could improve when doing the VnV report. The need for most of these changes came from our lack of understanding of JavaScript testing frameworks, and lack of attention paid to hidden features such as the required GitHub utilities in the various functionalities of the project. In the future, these changes could have been predicted by better paying attention to how each functionality could be tested while developing, or instead even following test driven development so these issues could have been caught earlier. Aside from these changes, our system tests did not have any issues. This is because we were heavily focusing on rigorously testing our project with the system tests as we were developing for the various demonstrations. With the heavy focused placed on testing of the core functionalities, we had enough evidence that our project demonstrates the required quality from the various system tests associated with both the functional and non functional requirements. From the various data we collected from the non functional tests it is evident that though, we require some changes which are outlined in the changes made due to testing section, these changes will be easy to implement to meet the required quality.
		\item Veerash: After finishing this report, I have realized a lot has changed since the original design, but that is the reason we need to fake the design process. One main way our report is different than the plan is through the NFR. A lot of the ways the NFR were originally planned to be tested were not feasible testing methods. The reason for this was that some of our NFRs were not verifiable in the first place and they should have been reworded or removed. To fix this in the reports, some of these NFRs were removed. This experience has taught me the lesson to come up with verifiable NFRs from the start rather than having to backtrack everything. After testing some off these NFRs, it also came to realization that some of criteria for success were unfeasible. This naturally happens in a lot of projects where we do not have the knowledge to correctly evaluate what is the threshold that is needed to consider a NFR successful. Thus these thresholds, for example, the expected rating in a survey had to be changed to accurately reflect our new knowledge that we gained about the software. These experience we gain will be greatly helpful in the future when we have to come up with ways to quantify our NFRs since we can base it of past knowledge. Another reason our report differed from our plan was the fact that when we were making the testing plans, we did not consider the functionality of these test cases under the lens of the tools we had such as Jest, the testing framework. Tests will needed to be written under the rules and constraints of the framework and these rules and constraints were not so obvious at the time the test plan was constructed since we have never used Jest before. Thus the way these tests had to be carried our had to vastly change, one such example is testing a api endpoint, but in our tests we did not have access to the authorization, thus the test had to be conducted directly on the lower level functions. The experience with a testing framework such as Jest will aid me in the future when I have to come with test plans since I will have the knowledge of the rules and the constraints of the tools being used.
		\item Kevin: There are several ways that we noticed were different from our initial VnV plan. The reason being that the software process is inherently complex and unpredictable, so there are unforeseen challenges or obstacles that may come up which would require us to pivot and change strategies or methods. One of the main differences is that certain features or requirements turned out to be harder to implement and test as we thought of before, especially ones that are involving integrations. Yes, I would anticipate these changes in the future by making sure that the VnV plan that I create would make sure it is flexible and adaptable to prepare for these changes. One way to implement this is by regularly visiting and iterating the VnV plan throughout the development process to ensure that it remains aligned with the evolving needs and requirements of the project. This could involve conducting ongoing risk assessments to identify potential areas of difficulty and uncertainty.
