\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the

{problem statement checklist}.}
\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required information.}

\subsection{Problem}

Latex is a common tool used by both students and researchers for writing reports and documents in an academic setting. Additionally, most of these academic works written in latex require a collaborative effort between multiple parties.
This then introduces the need to be able to see what the other parties have written in real time for the sake of editing and revising the work, as well as a need for version control to be able to track contributions between the parties 
in a safe manner. However, there is no current solution in the market to deal with both these issues at the same time in an effectively integrated environment.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}
