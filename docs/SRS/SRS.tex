	\section{Changes to template}
	
	The template was changed to include separate sections for main requirements and requirements for undesired events in the functional requirements section to create a better distinction between them and make the template easier to follow. Additionally sections to make a distinction between likely and unlikely changes in the functional requirements and rationale for specific requirements were also added. Lastly, additional sections to include the traceability matrix and phase in plan were added as they were missing from this template.
	
	\section{Project Drivers}
	
	\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
	
	The purpose of this project is to create a collaborative \textbf{LaTex} editing and compiling software that supports version control with\textbf{ Git }integration. The software will allow for multiple members of a team to view, edit and compile the same\textbf{tex}files at the same time while seeing the changes made by others in real time. This is especially useful for teams preparing project documentation where multiple members need to contribute to the documents in parallel, however it is widely intended for the development of any \textbf{LaTex} document by any number of contributors for any reason.\\
	\\The \textbf{LaTex} editor will support version control management through\textbf{ Git }integration so that the version history of any document created will be easily accessible. This is especially useful for documents that are likely to change over time due to revisions, such as software documentation and release notes
	
	
	\subsection{The Stakeholders}
	
	\subsubsection{The Client}
	
	The client of this software is Dr.Spencer Smith who has requested the development of this project for the software engineering Capstone course in order to solve a real world problem. The clients also include enterprises and companies that are seeking a standardized documentation software to prepare internal documents across teams who possess \textbf{LaTex} proficiency.
	
	\subsubsection{The Customers}
	The customers are the purchasers and users of this software. This includes individuals who wish to install the software for their personal use, students who wish to use the software for individual or team projects, companies and teams who wish to purchase a license and anyone else interesting in using the\textbf{tex}editor.\\
	Customers also include researchers, developers, and other secondary customers of the software such as employees of a company that chooses to make use of the software for their teams. Such employees will be interested in the usability and features of the product. Researchers and developers who are interested in the expansion of the document editor market or the development of such softwares are included in the stakeholders.\\
	
	\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
	Other stakeholders also include the primary developers and testers of this software, namely Faiq Ahmed, Eesha Qureshi, Veerash Palanichamy, and Kevin Kannammallil as their software engineering skills are a resource invested in this software and they are concerned in the outcome of this project.

		\subsubsection{Likely and Unlikely changes}
		
		\begin{tabular}{|l | p{85mm} |}
			\hline
			Likely Changes & FR9, FR10, FR15, FR19, FR33, FR40, FR41  \\
			\hline
			Unlikely Changes & FR1, FR2, FR3, FR4, FR5, FR6, FR7, FR8, FR11, FR12, FR13, FR14, FR16, FR17, FR18, FR20, FR21, FR22, FR23, FR24, FR25, FR26, FR27, FR28, FR29, FR30, FR31, FR32, FR34, FR35, FR36, FR37, FR38, FR39, FR42, FR43, FR44, FR45, FR46, FR47 \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		
		\subsubsection{Rationale and Clarifications}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item FR3: We require a log in using \textbf{Git} (specifically \textbf{GitHub}) so we can ask them for access a \textbf{GitHub} \textbf{API} token from them. This is necessary for the \textbf{Git} integration. The unique identities will be based on the \textbf{GitHub} account we get from the \textbf{API}.
			\item FR8: We must give an option to the user to import existing project that already has documentation. This way they can edit projects that they may have already created in the past.
			\item FR11: We only want to remove the project data from our app and not delete the project from \textbf{GitHub}. Deleting the project from \textbf{GitHub} is irreversible and should be done by the user directly from \textbf{GitHub} if they wish to do so. However deleting the project from our application does not prevent it from being reimported again later and does not have severe consequences.
			\item FR20: We want to display the text cursor of each collaborater that is currently working on the document, this way other users can see which part each person is working on in real time.
			\item FR21: We want users to be able to see what the other users are working on. This improves collaboration since multiple users can work on a task simultaneously and edit each others work without having to \textbf{commit}.
			\item FR35: We store all changes along with the details about the user, date and time instead of just storing it as a plain text file so we can use this information to allow users to select their sections for the \textbf{commits}.

	\section{Project Issues}
	
	\subsection{Open Issues}
	
	N/A
	
	\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
	
	The most popular off the self solution and a competitor to this project would be overleaf which is an open-source product. Although, Overleaf does its job as a \textbf{LaTex} editor that allows collaboration and shows real time edits of all users, it has poor \textbf{Git} integration and lacks proper version control. A lot of collaborative \textbf{LaTex} projects are hosted using \textbf{Git}, but do not have access to a live editor. Overleaf also lacks some commonly used \textbf{LaTex} features. UnderTree is going to be a collaborative real time text editor designed with \textbf{Git} support and users in mind.
	
	\subsection{New Problems}
	
	N/A
	
	\subsection{Tasks}
	
	As this project is part of the course Software Engineering 4G06, it will follow the product life cycle based on the deliverable outline of that course.\\
	Detailed tasks can be found in the ZenHub board that can be found in the project's \textbf{GitHub} repository.
	
	\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
	N/A
	
	\subsection{Risks}
	
	The biggest risk for this project that we should be concerned about is the processing speed of editing the file. Since multiple people can edit the same document at the same time, a correct concurrency implementation is required to ensure that the edits are smooth and do not freeze access for other users.
	
	\subsection{Costs}
	
	The only cost associated with this project is the cost for renting the server that the application would be hosted on, as well as a domain name. For a fixed price digital ocean server this cost would be 20\$/month with the domain name costing an additional 10\$/year.
	
	\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
	
	There is very little documentation that would be required on our part as the user is only required to be able to know \textbf{LaTex} to be able to use this product. However, we would have documentation on the same web applications that would point to existing resources that already exist to learn about \textbf{LaTex} from.
	
	\subsection{Waiting Room}
	There are several more additions that can be added given extra development time, but the main ones from highest priority are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ability to copy \& paste images into the \textbf{LaTex} file
		\item Simplify creating tables in \textbf{LaTex} 
		\item Ability to import word document which will be automatically converted to \textbf{LaTex}
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Appendix}
	
	\subsection{Knowledge Required}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item The team would need to be knowledgeable about the basics of front-end development. This includes knowledge of creating template with HTML, making complex and responsive designs with CSS, and using JavaScript to add interactivity to the web application. Additionally, to assist with the development speed of this project, the team should be knowledgeable about using front-end frameworks like React and CSS frameworks like Bulma to rapidly design the website.\\
		
		To be able to learn these technologies we can either look at tutorials on YouTube or use the documentation that is provided online for all these resources.\\
		
		\textbf{Faiq}: To be able to learn about these technologies, I think the best approach is looking at tutorials on YouTube. This is the preferred method since it helps apply the knowledge to a web development project that can easily be generalized to our own project as well.\\
		
		\textbf{Eesha}: The approach to gain working proficiency with these technologies is to consult documentation and practise developing simple components or side projects. This will help gain familiarity with the necessary core concepts and best practises.
		
		\textbf{Kevin}: I'm a big fan of tutorials that are on YouTube to learn stuff, especially for work regarding the front-end. Since that helps visualize what exactly I'm trying to create and how to do it. This will refresh my mind on best practices for front-end work.  
		
		\item All members of the team would need to be knowledgeable about software development in Rust. Since Rust is a relatively new programming language with a unique memory management system, members of the team would not be very familiar with being able to design the necessary software patterns in this language. The team would need to familiarize themselves with this language and the software design patterns that are the best fit for it.\\
		
		To be able to learn Rust, we can use the Rust book provided online by the Rust foundation, or look at tutorials on YouTube.\\
		
		\textbf{Faiq}: To be able to learn more about Rust, the best approach for me would be to look through the Rust book. This book is relatively short and goes over all the main topics of the language. It also contains several examples of full applications which would help up with applying the knowledge to our own project. Finally the book is also targeted towards people who are already experienced with programming and wish to learn Rust.
		
		\textbf{Veerash}: For the best approach to learn Rust would be to first read through the book for the basic feel and syntax of Rust. Then during implementation, I would watch YouTube tutorials how other people implement similar features in Rust which would better explain their reasoning for the implementation choices they make. Overall, these resources will always be revisited during implementation.
		
		\textbf{Kevin}: My preferred method of learning is to get into the book. I like to figure out how exactly the technology works and what happens under the hood. This gives me a deeper understanding and refines my approach to coding in Rust with the best practices. One of the key benefits of the book is the project section. One of the best ways for me to learn is to delve right in and get into a project. I'm confident that through this method, I'll be able to pick up the language and be comfortable working with it on the capstone project.
		
		\item All members of the team would need to be knowledgeable about network communication protocols such as HTTP and Web Sockets. These protocols are needed to enable interaction between the front-end and back end, as well as integration with the database. Additionally web sockets would be essential for implementing the live editing features as well as the chat feature for this project.\\
		
		To be able to learn about these protocols, we can either read articles on how these protocols work, watch YouTube tutorials or look for projects and repositories that use these protocols.\\
		
		\textbf{Faiq}: To be able to learn about these protocols, I will be reading up on articles on how to use these protocols and how to implement them with a project. Since the project might be language specific and would not give me a full understanding of the topics.
		
		\textbf{Veerash}: To learn about these protocols I will watch YouTube tutorials on network communication protocols. This is because I learn the best by watching other people, thus it complements my learning style. I will also look for other projects and repositories to further learn how others are implementing these protocols.
